Advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-on-singly-linked-list/).
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

In C, we can represent a node using structures. Below is an example of a linked list node with integer data.
In Java or C#, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.

```
class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* next;
};
```


```
// A simple CPP program to introduce
// a linked list
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* next;
};

// Program to create a simple linked
// list with 3 nodes
int main()
{
	Node* head = NULL;
	Node* second = NULL;
	Node* third = NULL;

	// allocate 3 nodes in the heap
	head = new Node();
	second = new Node();
	third = new Node();

	/* Three blocks have been allocated dynamically.
	We have pointers to these three blocks as head,
	second and third	
	head		 second		 third
		|			 |			 |
		|			 |			 |
	+---+-----+	 +----+----+	 +----+----+
	| # | # |	 | # | # |	 | # | # |
	+---+-----+	 +----+----+	 +----+----+
	
# represents any random value.
Data is random because we havenâ€™t assigned
anything yet */

	head->data = 1; // assign data in first node
	head->next = second; // Link first node with
	// the second node

	/* data has been assigned to the data part of first
	block (block pointed by the head). And next
	pointer of the first block points to second.
	So they both are linked.

	head		 second		 third
		|			 |			 |
		|			 |			 |
	+---+---+	 +----+----+	 +-----+----+
	| 1 | o----->| # | # |	 | # | # |
	+---+---+	 +----+----+	 +-----+----+	
*/

	// assign data to second node
	second->data = 2;

	// Link second node with the third node
	second->next = third;

	/* data has been assigned to the data part of the second
	block (block pointed by second). And next
	pointer of the second block points to the third
	block. So all three blocks are linked.
	
	head		 second		 third
		|			 |			 |
		|			 |			 |
	+---+---+	 +---+---+	 +----+----+
	| 1 | o----->| 2 | o-----> | # | # |
	+---+---+	 +---+---+	 +----+----+	 */

	third->data = 3; // assign data to third node
	third->next = NULL;

	/* data has been assigned to the data part of the third
	block (block pointed by third). And next pointer
	of the third block is made NULL to indicate
	that the linked list is terminated here.

	We have the linked list ready.

		head	
			|
			|
		+---+---+	 +---+---+	 +----+------+
		| 1 | o----->| 2 | o-----> | 3 | NULL |
		+---+---+	 +---+---+	 +----+------+	
	
	
	Note that only the head is sufficient to represent
	the whole list. We can traverse the complete
	list by following the next pointers. */

	return 0;
}
```
Linked List Traversal
```
// A simple C++ program for traversal of a linked list
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* next;
};

// This function prints contents of linked list
// starting from the given node
void printList(Node* n)
{
	while (n != NULL) {
		cout << n->data << " ";
		n = n->next;
	}
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	Node* head = NULL;
	Node* second = NULL;
	Node* third = NULL;

	// allocate 3 nodes in the heap
	head = new Node();
	second = new Node();
	third = new Node();

	head->data = 1; // assign data in first node
	head->next = second; // Link first node with second

	second->data = 2; // assign data to second node
	second->next = third;

	third->data = 3; // assign data to third node
	third->next = NULL;

	printList(head);

	return 0;
}
```
